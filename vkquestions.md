# Questions from Vincent Knight: Lecturer in Mathematics at Cardiff University.

1. With modern technology the amount of knowledge available to all is ever increasing. Sadly, a wide range of scientific work, often funded by the taxpayer, is published in journals that charge very large access fees. How would you suggest that government policy is fully informed by the best available and reliable scientific evidence, and that the public is able to evaluate the basis of these policy decisions?

2. The United Kingdom has a well thought out policy with regards to foreign relations. This stipulates the role of the country within the international community with regards to things like defence and aid. What do you feel should be the United Kingdom's role within the international scientific community?

3. In 2014, females are still under-represented in science. Do you personally feel that the current education system leads to an inclusive and fully representative scientific population?

4. What major scientific policies would you hope to see implemented in your lifetime?

5. What single major scientific discovery would you hope to see in your lifetime?
