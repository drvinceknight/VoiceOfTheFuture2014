# Voice of The Future

I am lucky enough to be nominated to attend the [Voice of the Future 2014](https://www.societyofbiology.org/events?event_id=345).

This allows me to submit questions to MPs, Ministers, Shadow Ministers and scientific policy advisors.

I asked on G+ for any suggestions of questions, you can see the discussion that incurred over [there](https://plus.google.com/+VincentKnight/posts/gpMSkrXzwXn).

This repo simply contains the list of questions that I ended up submitting.
